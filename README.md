Do you have black friends? Do you want a reminder whenever you have to read that one Black english book in class?

Forgetting the shortest month of the year can happen to us all. But this simple website reminds you of that special month.
So when the website says "YES" what now? Go outside and give Black people money ("reparations"), and stop saying the n-word.

Enjoy!
